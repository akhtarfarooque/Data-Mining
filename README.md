# Machine Learning Project

The aim of this Project

	The objective of this project is that we have applied various data mining classification techniques
on the telemarketing dataset which can help the banks in improving their strategies which they can apply on the target clients

	We have found factors from the telemarketing data such as age, balance, loan, duration etc
that will decide that whether a client would subscribe a bank term deposit or not

	Another important dimension for this project is finding the profiling factors/correlation 
between the various attributes and how they can impact the response of the clients.
